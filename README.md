Mars Weather Data Analysis
This project involves the analysis of Mars weather data to gain insights into the temperature and atmospheric pressure patterns on the Martian surface. The data used for analysis is obtained from Curiosity Rover's weather measurements.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the Mars weather data and answer several questions related to Martian weather patterns. The analysis includes finding the number of months on Mars, calculating the number of Martian days' worth of data, determining the average low temperature by month, identifying the coldest and hottest months, and visualizing the temperature and pressure trends.

Data
The data used for analysis is stored in a CSV file named mars_weather_data.csv. It contains the following columns:
id: Unique identifier for each data entry.
terrestrial_date: Date in Earth's calendar format.
sol: Martian day (Sol) number.
ls: Solar longitude (degrees).
month: Martian month.
min_temp: Minimum temperature recorded (in Celsius).
pressure: Atmospheric pressure recorded (in hPa).

mars_weather_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis.
mars_weather_data.csv: CSV file containing the Mars weather data.

The analysis provides answers to the following questions:

Number of months on Mars
Number of Martian days' worth of data
Average low temperature by month
Identification of the coldest and hottest months
Visualization of temperature and pressure trends
The results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook and visualized using various charts and plots.# web-scraping-_Module11_Challenge
